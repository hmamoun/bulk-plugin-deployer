# Password Saving Fix Summary

## Problem
When adding or editing a site in the Bulk Plugin Deployer, the FTP password was not being saved correctly. Specifically:

1. **New sites**: Passwords were saved correctly
2. **Editing existing sites**: When the password field was left blank (which is the default behavior for security), the existing password was being overwritten with an empty encrypted string

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `save_site()` method in `includes/class-bpd-site-manager.php`. The method was always encrypting the password field, even when it was empty during site updates. This caused existing passwords to be overwritten with empty encrypted strings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `save_site()` method logic:
- **For new sites**: Password is required and will be encrypted
- **For existing sites**: If password field is empty, keep the existing password; if password field has a value, encrypt and save the new password

### 2. Enhanced AJAX handlers with proper password logic:
- **`handle_save_site_ajax()`**: 
  - If `$_POST['ftp_password']` is set and not empty → use the new password
  - If editing existing site with empty password → get and decrypt password from database
  - If new site with empty password → return error
- **`handle_test_connection_ajax()`**: Same logic for connection testing

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript functionality:
- **When editing**: Removes the `required` attribute from password field and updates label to indicate it's optional
- **When clearing form**: Restores the `required` attribute and original label for new sites
- **Test connection**: Now passes site ID when testing connections for existing sites

### 4. Improved user experience:
- Added helpful description text under password field
- Dynamic label changes to indicate when password is optional
- Better visual feedback for form validation

## Files Modified

1. **`includes/class-bpd-site-manager.php`**
   - Updated `save_site()` method to handle empty passwords during updates
   - Added logic to preserve existing passwords when updating sites
   - **Enhanced `handle_save_site_ajax()`** with proper password handling logic
   - **Enhanced `handle_test_connection_ajax()`** with proper password handling logic

2. **`assets/js/admin.js`**
   - Enhanced `handleEditSite()` function to remove required attribute
   - Enhanced `clearSiteForm()` function to restore required attribute
   - Added dynamic label updates for better UX
   - **Enhanced `handleTestConnection()`** to pass site ID for existing sites

3. **`templates/admin-page.php`**
   - Added helpful description text under password field

4. **`assets/css/admin.css`**
   - Added styles for description text and label small text

## Testing

A debug script `debug-password-fix.php` has been created to test the password saving functionality. The script tests:

1. Creating new sites with passwords
2. Updating sites without changing passwords
3. Verifying passwords are preserved
4. Updating sites with new passwords
5. Verifying new passwords are saved correctly

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are still encrypted using WordPress authentication salts
- Password field is not populated when editing for security
- All existing security measures remain intact

## Extra Pro Debugging Tips

1. **Monitor Database Changes**: Use WordPress debug logging to track database operations:
   ```php
   define('WP_DEBUG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
   ```

2. **Test Password Encryption**: Verify encryption/decryption works correctly:
   ```php
   $site_manager = new BPD_Site_Manager();
   $encrypted = $site_manager->encrypt_password('test123');
   $decrypted = $site_manager->decrypt_password($encrypted);
   echo $decrypted === 'test123' ? 'Encryption works!' : 'Encryption failed!';
   ```

3. **Check AJAX Responses**: Monitor browser network tab to ensure AJAX requests are working correctly

4. **Database Inspection**: Directly check the database table to verify password storage:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, LEFT(ftp_password, 20) as password_preview 
   FROM wp_bpd_sites;
   ```
